# Gif Selector

## Project Description

####  This project is built using Vite + React.
##### The Web App can be viewed live [HERE](https://glittering-druid-30abac.netlify.app/) :point_left:

The website features a search function that enables users to search for specific gifs by entering relevant keywords. If users search for new gifs while viewing their favorites, they are automatically redirected to the home page.

Gif Selector allows users to select their favorite gifs with ease. Once selected, the gifs are saved in local storage for future access. Users can also remove gifs from their favorites by simply clicking on them again.

To manage state effectively, I employed **useContext** and **useReducer**.

To ensure a visually appealing and intuitive design, I utilized **CSS** for styling.

Thank you for taking the time to explore my project! :beers:
